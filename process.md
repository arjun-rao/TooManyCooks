# Final Project: Initial Brainstorming

- The game involves a group of players who play the role of chefs cooking a banquet dinner for a group of dignitaries of a large multinational company. A rival company hires a spy to ruin the evening by disguising themself as a cook with the sole objective of ruining the meals. The chefs donâ€™t know who the spy is.
- During the very initial process of brainstorming, while discussing mechanics and design goals, we realized that games like Among Us and Overcooked have very different communication requirements, we would have to decide which way we are leaning towards.
- We have quite a few ideas on table for now, out of which we would have to pick and leave some out depending on the balance that we are trying to strike with the game.
- The decision of whether the game is going to be couch co-op or online might impact some of the design decisions as the actions of the spy would remain more discreet if it is played online.
- We also had a discussion regarding whether or not the Spy would be able to kill other chefs in scenarios where they are caught in the act.(This was thought of in order to consider the possibility of giving the spy a chance to fix things). In such a case, the spy would also have to hide the body and clean up the mess. This led to further discussion regarding the decision to add visual cues while the spy poisons something.
- Another idea to avoid this was to have poisoned versions of the ingredients that the spy would use instead of poisoning the dishes. We thought this would make it a little more discreet. We were thinking somewhere along the lines of having a pantry where the poisoned items would be visible only to the spy behind a blank box.
- We realised that one key aspect to keep in mind during the design phase of the game is the balance between the difficulty for the Spy and the chefs. Especially in games like these, it would be very crucial to strike this balance.

# Final Project: Core Values and Mechanics

## Core Values
  * The core values explored in our game are of co-operation and subterfuge. An uninformed majority of players are pitted against an informed adversary where majority of players do not know who the adversary is, and try and determine the rogue player through observation and deduction. 
  
## Core Mechanics
  *  The game involves players completing a set of dishes within a given time (approx 10 minutes), if all dishes are completed, then the chefs win.
  *  One player is assgined the role of a spy who has access to a set of poisoned ingredients, that other players cannot access. 
  *  If a dish that is poisoned is served, the dignitary who consumes it will be escorted out by medical team due to food poisoning - this triggers a vote among players to identify a potential spy. If the spy is voted out, the game ends, and the chefs win.
  *  If the chefs fail to serve all dishes in time or half the dignitiaries are poisoned, the spy wins. 
  *  The game mechanic involves moving between various stations (oven station, dessert station, prep station, etc) to collect and process ingredients to make a dish as indicated by a task bar showing the combinations of ingredients needed for a dish. 
  *  There are visual cues that show a dish is being poisoned but a poisoned dish doesn't differ visually from a normal dish. 
  * Pans can be poisoned while empty, which requires players to clean it (costing them time).
  * The spy also has access to the electrical room to turn off power to ovens or lights. 
  * Players have only one chance to vote out the spy if they are certain by calling a meeting.

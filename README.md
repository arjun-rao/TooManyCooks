#### Game Summary

The main idea of this project is to make a game combining the mechanics of “Overcooked” and “Among Us”. We plan to build it as an online multiplayer game designed to work on phones.  The game involves a group of players who play the role of chefs cooking a banquet dinner for a group of dignitaries of a large multinational company. A rival company hires a spy to ruin the evening by disguising themself as a cook with the sole objective of ruining the meals. The chefs don’t know who the spy is. 

The game mechanic borrows concepts of cooking dishes according to a recipe from Overcooked and the concept of a spy/imposter from Among Us. While the two games have very different communication needs between players we hope to incorporate them in a way that balances the need for extensive communication in Overcooked with the concept of designated periods of communication from Among Us.
